With varying levels of computer literacy and knowledge of the Schoolzine platform, a categorical approach is implemented. To assist users with limited knowledge of terminology, the user can follow a top down approach narrowing in on the information then required. Moreover, this provides the user with nuance in what each system provides and its functionality. However, it was identified that users may require an option for rapid navigation and filtering. Therefore a search feature is implemented to search for results based on keywords."

User testing was performed by small business owners receiving positive feedback. The recurring consensus was the straight to the point approach was preferred without having to navigate through a “sales page”. Initially the website was going to be developed with the React library. However, as SEO is important NextJS was used instead capitalising on its server-side rendering. Additionally, using OOP the website is developed in components to provide easy maintenance and flexibility."
